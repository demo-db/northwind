// Checks the meaning graph with the pinned meaninggraph tool, in one run:
//   meaninggraph check model <core> --address <this repository>=model --graph github.com/meaninggraph/core=<core>
// <core> is a checkout of meaninggraph/core at the commit the meaning file pins. Naming it both as a path to check and
// as the directory --graph supplies makes it a graph checked in full, once, with every rule (as the repository's own
// checker did), and the model's graph is checked with it supplied. --address gives this repository's graph its address
// (read from ovdb.yaml, meaning.graph.address, where check:ovdb already holds it to the repository), so a meaning://
// reference from the file to its own repository resolves. The paths are the same spelling in all three places: the
// tool compares them as written, made absolute and cleaned.
// The commit is read from the meaning file's own ?ref= pins (one pin, a full commit id), never written a second time
// here; a meaning file with no reference to core is refused (Chinook depends on it). The checkout comes from the
// resolver in scripts/lib/meaning.mjs (a shallow fetch of that commit, kept in .cache/meaning-sources under its id
// and made that commit again before it is reused). meaninggraph reads the checkout's .git/HEAD and refuses a
// checkout at another commit than the pin, which is the proof the right graph was used. It validates against the
// schema embedded in its own binary: scripts/check-schema.mjs compares that with the checkout's meaning.schema.json.
// The exit code is the tool's: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage or unreadable (also: no single pin, no checkout, a file
// that is not YAML).
